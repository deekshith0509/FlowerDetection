# 🌻Flower Detection Project

## ⚓Overview
  <div style="padding-left: 20px;">  The Flower Detection Project aims to develop a machine learning model capable The Flower Detection Project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying different types of flowers from images. Additionally, it includes an interactive chatbot, FlowerBot, which provides information about specific flowers and their attributes. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of various flower images belonging to different categories such as daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, and tulip.

## 🪶Features
- **Image Recognition**: Upload an image of a flower, and the model will classify it into one of the predefined categories with a confidence score.

- **FlowerBot Chat**: Engage in conversation with FlowerBot to learn more about specific flowers or their attributes.

- **Dataset Exploration**: Explore the dataset used for training the flower detection model, including sample images and categories.

- **Data Augmentation**: See how data augmentation techniques such as random flipping, rotation, and zooming are applied to enhance the model's robustness.

- **Model Training**: Learn about the architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN) used for training the flower detection model, as well as the training process and evaluation metrics.

- **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model for real-world applications, such as integrating it into web or mobile apps for automatic flower recognition.

## 💻Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
 
```
         git clone https://github.com/deekshith0509/flower-detection.git

```
2. Install the required dependencies: 

```
         pip install -r requirements.txt`

```
3. Run the Streamlit app: 

```
         streamlit run interface.py

```
## 👨‍💻Usage
Once the Streamlit app is running, you can interact with the following features:

- Upload an image for image recognition.
- Chat with FlowerBot to learn more about specific flowers or their attributes.
- Explore the dataset and view sample images.
- Train and evaluate the flower detection model.
- Deploy the model for real-time flower recognition.

## 🚂Dataset
The dataset used for training the flower detection model consists of images of various flowers, including daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, and tulip. It is structured into different directories, each corresponding to a specific flower category.
