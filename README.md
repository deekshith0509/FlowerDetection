  pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
  pkg install git
  git clone https://github.com/deekshith0509/FlowerDetection
  cd FlowerDetection
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Run Locally

Clone the project
open th command prompt

```bash
  pip install jupyterlab
  jupyter lab
```
Go to the cloned directory in the jupyter notebook and open the 
Flower_recog_Model.ipynb file.Now,Run code from each cell sequentially.
After the creation of the model,the model can be tested in two ways:toolkit Interface and streamlit.

    streamlit run app.py  ##to create a web application based testing interface
    python sample.py #for testing with toolkit interface using pythn
